# device-service
- A service to book the mobile devices and query information about them.
- The service stores the current state of the world in [SQLite database](device-service-server/src/test/resources/database.db).
  - Reads and writes to the database are thread safe.
- The information about the devices is fetched from [Rapid API's Mobile Phone Specs Service](https://rapidapi.com/makingdatameaningful/api/mobile-phone-specs-database)
  - The responses from Rapid API are cached in memory in the [Caffeine Cache](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine)  
- Additionally, if the api token is not specified (or is invalid) in [var/conf.yml](device-service-server/var/conf/conf.yml#L14), the service will fall back to a scrapped GSM Arena Website Database (available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imprime/gsmarena-listed-brands)). The downloaded CSV is stored in [device-service/device-service-server/src/test/resources](device-service-server/src/test/resources/gsmarena_dataset.csv)
- The service template used: [conjure-java-example](https://github.com/palantir/conjure-java-example)

## How to run locally
### Running the server
- clone the repo
- `cd device-service`
- set `JAVA_HOME` to java 15
- update the Rapid API token in the [var/conf.yml](device-service-server/var/conf/conf.yml#L14)
  - `vim device-service-server/var/conf/conf.yml` (and replace `api-key` value)
  - you can leave it as is, the service will fall back to the [gsmarena_dataset.csv](device-service-server/src/test/resources/gsmarena_dataset.csv) 
- `./gradlew run`

### Checking the state of DB
- `sqlite3 database.db`
- `SELECT * FROM devices;`

## APIs
### Device registration and deletion:
```

```

### Reserving and returning the device:
#### using the device name
```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"person": "Andrej", "deviceName": "Nokia 3310"}' "http://localhost:8346/api/v1/booking/reserve"
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"person": "Andrej", "deviceName": "Nokia 3310"}' "http://localhost:8346/api/v1/booking/return"
```

#### using the device ID
```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"person": "Andrej", "deviceId": 10}' "http://localhost:8346/api/v1/booking/reserve"
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"person": "Andrej", "deviceId": 10}' "http://localhost:8346/api/v1/booking/return" 
```

### Tools and Libraries

This service uses the following tools and libraries, please consult their respective documentation for more information.
* [conjure](https://github.com/palantir/conjure) - IDL for defining APIs once and generating client/server interfaces in different languages.
    * [conjure-java-runtime](https://github.com/palantir/conjure-java-runtime/) - conjure libraries for HTTP&JSON-based RPC using Retrofit, Feign, OkHttp as clients and Jetty/Jersey as servers
    * [conjure-java](https://github.com/palantir/conjure-java) - conjure generator for java clients and servers 
    * [conjure-typescript](https://github.com/palantir/conjure-typescript) - conjure generator for typescript clients
* [gradle](https://gradle.org/) - a highly flexible build tool. Some of the gradle plugins applied are:
     *  [gradle-conjure](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-conjure) - a gradle plugin that contains tasks to generate conjure bindings.
     *  [gradle-baseline](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline) - a gradle plugin for configuring code quality tools in builds and projects.
* [undertow](https://undertow.io/) - a simple framework for building web services

### Project Structure

* `device-service-api` - a sub-project that defines device-service APIs in Conjure and generates both java and typescript bindings.

    This is what the api project looks like:
    ```
    ├── device-service-api
    │   ├── build.gradle
    │   ├── device-service-api-dialogue
    │   ├── device-service-api-objects
    │   ├── device-service-api-typescript
    │   ├── device-service-api-undertow
    │   └── src
    │       └── main
    │           └── conjure
    │               └── device-service-api.yml
    ```
    * `build.gradle` - a gradle script that 
        1. configures sub-projects with needed dependencies to generate java bindings. e.g. `device-service-api-dialogue`
        2. configures `publishTypescript` task to generate `.npmrc` in the generated root folder, `device-service-api-typescript/src` for publishing the generated npm module.
        3. modifies the `conjure` extension to specify the package name under which the npm module will be published.
    * `device-service-api-dialogue` - the sub-project where all generated [service interfaces](device-service-api/src/main/conjure/device-service-api.yml#L51) live.
    * `device-service-api-objects` - the sub-project where all generated [object classes](device-service-api/src/main/conjure/device-service-api.yml#L4) live.
    * `device-service-api-typescript` - the sub-project where all generated typescript bindings live.
    * `src/main/conjure` - directory containing conjure definition yml files where recipe APIs are defined, please refer to [specification.md](https://github.com/palantir/conjure/blob/develop/docs/specification.md) for more details.

* `device-service-server` - an Undertow application project that uses conjure generated Undertow binding for resource class implementation

    This is what the server project looks like:
    ```
    ├── device-service-server
    │   ├── build.gradle
    │   ├── src
    │   │   ├── main/java
    │   │   └── test/java
    │   └── var
    │       └── conf
    │           └── conf.yml
    ```
    * `build.gradle` - configures the project with needed dependencies and applies the `gradle-conjure` and `application plugins`, so we can run the server locally or in IDE.
    * `src/main/java` - source classes for the Undertow application. e.g. `DeviceBookingResource.java` class `implements` the generated Undertow interface.
    * `test/main/java` - test source classes for simple integration tests that uses generated jersey interface for client interaction.
    * `var/conf/conf.yml` - the Undertow application configuration yml file

* `build.gradle` - the root level gradle script where a set of gradle plugins are configured, including [gradle-conjure](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-conjure).
* `settings.gradle` - the gradle settings file where all sub projects are configured.
* `versions.props` - a property file of the [nebula version recommender plugin](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/nebula-dependency-recommender-plugin) with which we can specify versions of project dependencies, including conjure generators.

## Development

### Useful Gradle Commands:

* `./gradlew tasks` for tasks available in this project.
* `./gradlew idea` for IntelliJ
* `./gradlew eclipse` for Eclipse
